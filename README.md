# Dialogue-Summarization

This is a project on Dialogue Summmarization task using Generative AI. I explored how the input text affects the output of the model, and performed prompt engineering to direct it towards the task I need. I compared zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences and saw how it can enhanced the generative output of Large Language Models.

## Dataset
The dataset used was from hugging face named - "knkarthick/dialogsum". DialogSum is a large-scale dialogue summarization dataset, consisting of 13,460 (Plus 100 holdout data for topic generation) dialogues with corresponding manually labeled summaries and topics. The data fields are - dialogue: text of dialogue, summary: human written summary of the dialogue, topic: human written topic/one liner of the dialogue, id: unique file id of an example.
